## Introduction

I love to eat salads. They are such a great way to make the most out of your fruits and vegetables, plus they're packed with protein and healthy fats. The Mediterranean diet is all about using whole foods like fresh fruits, nuts and grains as well as lean meats like fish and poultry without adding any processed ingredients that aren't beneficial for your health (like sugar). This salad is perfect for someone looking for an easy meal that tastes delicious but also has no added calories or carbs!

## Pick your veggies. You can use arugula, fennel, hearts of palm, artichokes, asparagus, peas, tomatoes and/or mushrooms. The more the merrier.

* Pick your veggies. You can use arugula, fennel, hearts of palm, artichokes, asparagus, peas and/or mushrooms in this recipe. The more the merrier! If you're on a diet or trying to eat healthy at all times (and who isn't?), then feel free to use less dressing on your salad; however if your goal is just eating delicious food without guilt then go ahead and add as much dressing as you want!

## Pick a protein. You can choose shrimp, crabmeat, seared tofu, chicken or salmon.

* Protein is important for building muscle, keeping you full and providing energy.
* You can find protein in many different types of food, including meat. Shrimp, crabmeat and tofu are good sources of protein; salmon is a good source of omega-3 fatty acids.

## Pick some cheese. Some nice options are feta or Parmesan cheese.

* Add the olive oil, vinegar, salt and pepper to taste.
* Mix everything together with your hands until it’s all combined well—you don’t want any big chunks of unmelted cheese in your salad!

## Pick your herbs. Fresh mint and basil make super additions to this salad.

* Mint is a great choice because it's so aromatic, but if you don't have access to fresh mint leaves then dried will do just fine! Just keep in mind that the flavor will be slightly less intense than when using fresh leaves.
* If you want something more robust than just a subtle hint of flavor, try using basil instead of mint—it adds even more depth!

## Choose your vinaigrette wisely. An extra virgin olive oil and red wine vinegar dressing is my favorite choice for this salad type because it highlights the natural flavors of fruits and vegetables while complementing the fish and meat choices nicely with its pungency and acidity.

The acidity of the vinegar and pungency of the olive oil complement each other. The flavors are highlighted by their different tastes, which is why an extra virgin olive oil and red wine vinegar dressing is my favorite choice for this salad type.
